## About SSN Coding Exercise

Write a program in your language of choice (though PHP, JavaScript, Python, or C# is preferred) that generates all possible Social Security Numbers that meet the following criteria:

- Social Security Numbers are in the format of ###-##-####
- The first 3-digit piece of the SSN is a prime number
- The second 2-digit piece of the SSN is a prime number
- The third 4-digit piece of the SSN is a prime number
- The entire 9-digit number is a prime number

Example test cases:
002-02-0002 would not pass because while the first four criteria would be met (2 is prime), the last case is not met (2020002 is not prime).
002-02-0003 would pass all five criteria because 2, 3, and 2020003 are all prime.
